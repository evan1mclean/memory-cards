# Memory Card Game

This is a React app to play a memory game. A number of cards appear on the screen and you get points by clicking on cards that haven't been clicked before. If you click one that's already been selected, your score will reset. It also keeps track of your best score.

The goal with this project was to get used to using functional react components and using react hooks instead of the classic class based components with lifecycle methods.

Since this is a game where you click on some kind of card, I decided to model it after one of my favorite video games of all time, Super Smash Bros. Melee.
